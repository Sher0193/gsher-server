   "statement":[

      "I endeavour with my paintings to express a sense of a particular place through an examination of the environmental and human forces that shape it.  The subjects of the paintings reflect the various aspects of the Ontario landscape, especially those found in Huron and Bruce counties, with emphasis on the water, the fields, the sky and its changing patterns of weather."
